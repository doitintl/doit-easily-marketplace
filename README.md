![Diagram](img/simple-arch.png)

## Components

### GCP owned
* **marketplace listing**: The marketplace listing your customer's use to subscribe to your service. Used for public and private offers.
* **procurement api**: REST API to inform Google about entitlement and account statuses
* **service api**: REST API to inform Google about usage for usage based billing
* **isv-public topic**: pub/sub topic where Google publishes entitlment events (creation requested, update requested, etc)

### ISV owned
* **frontend-integration**: public website where customers are redirected after subscribing to your listing. Does JWT validation and gives you an opportunity to collect additional customer information (for storing in your own DB)
* **backend-integration**: service to receive and respond to entitlement events from Google. Provides a simplified API to interact with the procurement API
* **isv-public subscription**: subscription to the "isv-public topic"
* **isv provision service**: an optional service (not provided by this repository) which listens to events from the backend-integration. This service would provision resources in your backend for SaaS customers
* **usage-reporter**: an optional service (only required for usage based billing, not provided by this repository) which reports usage metrics to Google's Service API
* **service account**: the doit-easily service account which runs your backend-integration. This service account has roles to interact with the procurement API and subscribe to the isv-public topic.
