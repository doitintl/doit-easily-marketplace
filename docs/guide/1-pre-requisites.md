# Pre-Requisites

## Terraform

These steps can be accomplished by applying this [Terraform](../terraform/setup/) module.

## The Process

1. Create a project to hold your listings and backend integration workloads. The project name should be in the format `ISV-public` or otherwise clear it is a marketplace project.

1. Grant Google procurement user access to your listing project ([role detail](../terraform/setup/iam.tf)).

1. Create a service account to run your integration workloads.

1. Verify that the user applying the app deploy terraform has `serviceAccountTokenCreator` role on the `doit-easily` SA created in this step
