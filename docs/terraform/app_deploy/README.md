# App Deploy Terraform

This module deploys doit-easily into cloudrun, including all required infrastucture  
Before applying this module, the [setup module][1] must be applied (or equivilent resources applied)

## What this Terraform deploys

![Diagram](../../../img/component-arch.png)


The `app_deploy` terraform module will install & configure the following components/features:

* Deploy the backend integration into Cloud Run (must run as the service account `doit-easily` created previously).

* Create a push subscription on the topic `projects/cloudcommerceproc-prod/topics/ISV-public`, using the Cloud Run backend integration URL for the push endpoint.

* Deploy the backend UI into Cloud Run (optional if `AUTO_APPROVE_ENTITLEMENTS` is set to `true`).

* Deploy the frontend UI into Cloud Run (optional, you can also deploy your own frontend integration).

* Enable authentication for the backend (IAP).

* Create a default secret `settings-toml` which contains a default config


# Important Notes About the module

### You need an existing DNS zone
This terraform assumes you have a DNS zone already created. See [loadbalancer.tf](../docs/terraform/app_deploy/loadbalancer.tf) (line 3). If you need a new zone created, you'll need to modify the terraform to create the zone rather than reference one that exists.

### You need to update the secret setting-toml

This module creates a secret in Secret Manager named [settings-toml](../app_deploy/app.tf#L58) which is mounted to your Cloud Run service. The secret contains [initial](./custom-settings.toml) _default values_ which must be updated for DoiT-Easily to run correctly.

You must either:

*  put your secrets in the [custom-settings.toml](./custom-settings.toml) before applying the terraform 
*  after applying the terraform initially, manually update the secret in Secret Manager and then update the [secret_version](./example.tfvars#L2) in your tfvar file

### Granting users access to the backend UI

users need to be granted the `IAP-secured Web App User` role on the [IAP console](https://console.cloud.google.com/security/iap)
