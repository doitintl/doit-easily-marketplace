# DoiT-Easily Installation Guide


## Terraform modules

There are two Terraform modules in this directory: `setup` and `app_deploy`. They correspond with installation steps below.

* `setup`: all the resources for pre-requisites
* `app_deploy`: all the resources for deploying the app

You can apply the modules using either one of the following methods:

- Adding a `.tfvars` file with appropriately configured variables to directly apply the entire modules.

- Copying the pertinent files to your own terraform modules and apply them there.

How you incorporate these files into your CICD system is up to you. While we strive to not make breaking changes the Terraform modules, we can't promise we won't.
