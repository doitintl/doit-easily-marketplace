# Install Doit-Easily

This process is the distilled instructions found [here][3], plus information to deploy Doit-Easily.

**Terraform modules**

There are two Terraform modules in this directory: `setup` and `app_deploy`. They correspond with installation steps below.

You can apply the modules using either one of the following methods:

- Adding a `.tfvars` file with appropriately configured variables to directly apply the entire modules.

- Copying the pertinent files to your own terraform modules and apply them there.

We recommend the first approach, using the requested variables.

## Setup

Note: These steps can be accomplished by applying this [Terraform][6] or [gcloud][7].

1. Create a project to hold your listings and backend integration workloads. The project name should be in the format `ISV-public`.

1. Grant Google procurement user access to your listing project ([role detail][9]).

1. Create a service account to run your integration workloads.

## Create a listing and start submitting details

The following steps are completed in your web browser and Producer Portal.

1. Submit your product information using this [Google Form][1].

1. Create a new SaaS listing in the [Producer Portal][2]. 

1. Start the process of submitting pricing & product information. This can be done in parallel to the technical integration.  

1. In the Producer Portal (see screen capture below):

   1. Link the service account to call the Procurement API and Cloud Pub/Sub Integration.

   1. Copy the Pub/Sub topic string for later users.
       Use the format `projects/cloudcommerceproc-prod/topics/ISV-public`.

1. (Optional) In Slack, create a Slack webhook to store this secret in Secret Manager.

## Deploy the App

Note: These steps can be accomplished by applying this [Terraform][8].

1. Deploy the application in Cloud Run. When finished, continue below.

## Finish and test the integration

1. In the Producer Portal, add the frontend integration URL to the Technical Integration -> Frontend Integration `Sign up URL`.

     1. (Optional.) Use a custom domain by setting up a load balancer in front of Cloud Run.

     2. (Optional.) Add the SSO Login URL for your console, and support SSO.
